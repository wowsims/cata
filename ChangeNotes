line 27: base cast time seems to be 2.55s (see math below)
line 28: remove (improved fireball is no longer a talent)
line 29: remove (glyph no longer affects cast time)
line 35: remove (improved scorch no longer gives crit to spells)
line 36: append the prime glyph (+5% crit chance to fireball)



13.05% haste, 2.21s cast time
86.95% of the og cast time
2.21 = x * 86.95
2.21/.8695 = 2.55s
